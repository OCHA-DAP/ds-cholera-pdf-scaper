The humanitarian situation in Cameroon’s North-West and South-West regions remains dire, with continued violence and insecurity disrupting essential services. In April 2025
alone, over 12 deadly incidents were recorded in Mezam division, while nearly 200 protection incidents, including killings and abductions, were reported across both regions.
Attacks on schools and military use of facilities disrupted education for over 32 000 learners. Only 48% of community water points are functional, and many schools and health
facilities face severe WASH gaps, increasing disease risk. More than 400 children with severe acute malnutrition received lifesaving treatment. Ongoing farmer-herder tensions,
compounded by climate stress and conflict, continue to displace civilians. Funding cuts have forced key humanitarian activities to scale down, limiting protection services and
data collection.

of the Congo Humanitarian crisis
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is facing a complex and worsening humanitarian crisis, driven by ongoing conflict, large-scale displacement, and public health
emergencies. Despite a truce announced in April 2025, continued violence in North and South Kivu and Ituri provinces has displaced thousands and resulted in the reported
deaths of over 300 civilians in just two weeks. Grave child rights violations persist, with more than 70% of verified cases involving recruitment and use of children. In South
Kivu, flooding in Kasaba village claimed 62 lives, including 47 children. Adding to the crisis, a nationwide cholera epidemic has placed six provinces under alert, with sustained
transmission in the east further straining overstretched health services and deepening the vulnerability of affected communities.

As of September 2024, the last Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) report published in Mali recorded 378,363 internally displaced persons (IDPs)—a 15% increase from
330,713 in May, driven by severe flooding and growing insecurity. Women and children make up 86% of those displaced. Due to a freeze in U.S. funding, further DTM updates
have been suspended. The food security outlook remains critical, with 2.3 million people projected to face food crises in 2025, particularly affecting children under five and
pregnant or breastfeeding women. In response, the WHO launched the CERF project in Gao on 29 May 2025, aiming to improve healthcare access for 10,000 IDPs over ten
months. Concurrently, over 4,000 Malians have been forcibly repatriated from Mauritania since February 2025 and are now hosted in Khabou, near the border. Most arrivals
have health issues and are treated at Lany Tounka CSCOM, located 5 km away. However, the health system's capacity is overwhelmed, and key health partners are absent. The
WHO provided emergency medical kits, including IEHKs and malaria kits, to meet the health needs of 10,000 people for three months.
